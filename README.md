## 📁 Folder structure

-   `/public`: publicly accessible contents (ex: images, media).
-   `/src`: all the components used in this project.
    -   `/src/components/`: each reusable components of each pages.
    -   `/src/data`: configurations of the web app.
    -   `/src/pages`: pages that include in the web app.

## ⚙️ Configurations

Since this is a public and open source project, you can make any changes to it. If you are a ReactJS developer you can do it easily. But if you are a beginner, I have extracted the configurable data into a single directory, so you can edit the files in that directory to configure the entire web application.

Directory: `/src/data/`

-   `user.js`

    From this you can change the content of each page of the web application.


-   `seo.js`

    The SEO.js file is a module that contains an array of objects, with each object representing metadata for a specific page of a React website. The purpose of this file is to centralize and manage the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) information for different pages.


-   `styles.css`

    From this you can change the font colors and font families of the web application.

    ```css
    :root {
    	/* ------- colors ------- */
    	--primary-color: #27272a;
    	--secondary-color: #65656d;
    	--tertiary-color: #acacb4;
    	--quaternary-color: #e4e4e7;
    	--link-color: #14b8a6;
    	/* ---------------------- */

    	/* ------- fonts ------- */
    	--primary-font: "Heebo", sans-serif;
    	--secondary-font: "Roboto", sans-serif;
    	/* --------------------- */
    }
    ```
